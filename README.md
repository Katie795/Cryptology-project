# Cryptology-project
We are aiming to create a website which explores a few of the basic types of Ciphers.
This website is going to be fun and friendly, and aimed towards younger people who are
interested in ciphers and puzzles, rather than a serious website. Note that all of these ciphers can be solved with pencil and paper! (should say this in the website)
