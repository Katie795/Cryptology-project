<h3>Homophonic substitution cipher</h3>
<div><p>With the advent of Frequency analysis, the Monoalphabetic Cipher was compromised. An upgrade was desparately needed!
The Homophonic cipher was invented to essentially cover up the flaw exposed by frequency analysis.</p>
<p>The idea was to represent each letter with more than one substitution, depending on how often the letter appeared
  normally. For example, since the letter e occurs 12% of the time, it would be represented by 12 separate symbols, wheras
  the letter z would only be represented by 1 symbol.</p></div>
