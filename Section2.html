<h3>The Enigma machine(Perhaps a note on how we canâ€™t do a challenge? Or remove it altogether?)</h3>
Bletchly park. Alan Turing, and a team of cryptanalysists. A captured enigma machine. Figured out how it works, and how it is implemented.

Describe and example


<h3>The RSA code</h3>
The RSA code was accredited to Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, a team of researchers in MIT, laboratories, who finalised the idea of an asymmetric cipher in 1977 first published by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. However, the idea was originally thought up by Clifford Cocks in 1973 in GCHQ, but it's discovery was kept secret for national security reasons.
