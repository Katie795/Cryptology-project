<h3>The Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
<p>This type of cipher is a step up from the Caesar cipher in that instead of having just 25 possible ciphers,
  any permutation of letters is allowed! See diagram
 This means that there are 40000000000000000000000000 possible outcomes that could happen! In fact, up until the 16th Century,
 this cipher seemed impossible to crack. The technique of frequency analysis was invented
  by Al Kindi, the ‘Philosopher of Arabs’, and was a major breakthrough in the battle between cryptographers and cryptanalysists.</p>


<p>The key to cracking this cipher lies in the fact that some letters appear more than others, depending on the language. For example,
Al Kindi found that the letters a and l appear more often that the other letters in Arabic. Likewise, in English, the most common
 letter in English is e, which occurs 12.7% of the time, followed by t, then a, then o. Of course, the shorter the text, the more
 likely the letters are to deviate from the norm!</p>
