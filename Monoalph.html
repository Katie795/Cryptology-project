    <p>The Monoalphabetic Cipher was much more secure and was regarded as unbreakable until the 16th century. The technique to solve it was invented
    by Al Kindi, who was known by some as the ‘Philosopher of Arabs’, and this was a major breakthrough in the battle between cryptographers and cryptanalysists.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>This type of cipher is a step up from the Caesar cipher. It is similar in some respects, as each letter is swapped with another in the alphabet.
   However, instead of having just 25 possible ciphers, any permutation of letters is allowed! For example, </p>

 <div class=container><p> is a valid cipher. As you can probably imagine, there are a many more possible combinations than the Caesar cipher.
   In fact, there are more than 40000000000000000000000000 possible combinations! You can see why it was seen as impossible to crack for
 so long.</p>

<div><h2>How to solve</h2>
<p>Thankfully, it is not uncrackable. The key to cracking this cipher lies in the fact that some letters appear more than others, depending on the language. For example,
Al Kindi found that in Arabic, the letters a and l appear more often that the other letters. Likewise, in English, the most common
 letter is e, which occurs 12.7% of the time. This is followed by t, then a, then o. A graph of the frequency of letters in Engish is found below:</p>

  <div class='col-sm-8'>
    <img src='./Images/freq-ana.jpg'><br><br><br>
  </div>

  <p>Armed with this very useful information, we are now ready to crack the cipher! A surefire way to get started is to count the frequency of the letters, and guess,
    based on how often each letter appears and where it appears, the most common letters. From there we can fill in the gaps. For example, having guessed e and t,
    if we find a sequence tXe, we can make an educated guess that X is h, and fill in all the h's from there. Of course, the shorter the text, the more likely
      frequency of the letters are to deviate from the norm.</p>
