<h3>The Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
Also called the Chiffre Inde(acute)chiffrable. Had been in the process of being made but was finalised by Blaise de Viginere, a French diplomat. Polyalphabetic. Broken by Charles Babbage an English Mathematitian.

Describe and example

After the discovery of the tool of frequency analysis to crack the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, a new type of code had to be invented. The idea was to use not just one, but several Caesar ciphers all at once, so frequency analysis is rendered useless. Look at this diagram:

Use a codeword to pick the order of the Caesar Ciphers. Under this word, Hello would be translated to, hence the double l could no longer be analysed.
