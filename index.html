  <h2>Cryptology through the ages</h2>
  <p>A brief description of a few types of encryption employed throughout history.

  * Notes for reference*
  This is not a full history of Ciphers throughout the ages, rather the aim of this site is to try and introduce some of the stories and techniques, and to see how it has changed through the years.

  Target Audience: Perhaps young people who are interested in puzzles and techniques

  Introduction and background

  Exciting introduction and brief explanation for the general cipher

  With the evolution of language and writing, it seems like in every culture there has also been an evolution of the means to secrecy. Ever since humans have been at war with each other, the need to communicate secretly has been important.  There has been a constant race between the code makers and the code breakers, like an intellectual arms race.

  The main focus of this site will be cryptology, which is defined as the science of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Kryptos is the Greek work for to hide, graphein to write and analusis to unloosen. A cipher is a tool used by the cryptographer to create a ciphertext, from the message that the sender wants to send. Using the right Key, the receiver should be able to decipher the message with ease,  however it should be difficult to decode.

  NOTES

  Cryptology is the science of cryptography and cryptanalysis.

  Difference between a code and a cipher. Codes substitution on the level of words or phrases MEANING. Cipher is an ALGORITHM

  Cipher should be easy to implement but difficult to decode.

  Origin of  the word Cryptography (Crypto)-  Greek Word Kryptos to hide graphein- to write

  Esssentially means it is scrambled according to a particular protocol to render it useless

  Cryptography is either TRANSPOSITION (rearranged), rail fence. or SUBSTITUTION( replaced)  (Playfair Ciphers)

  Earliest descriptions of Subsitution is in Karma sutra, under 64 reccomended arts for women to study

  Code a lot more effort to define. Disaterous if falling into the wrong hands.
  Knowledge of the plaintext


  Stenography(covering the message)
