<br><p class='lead'>Through an organisation called Code First: Girls, who's aim is to deliver free community coding courses to female university students  all over the UK,
  we learned how to make our own website using a variety of different programming languages.
  Using the skills that had been taught to use we created this website from our joined passion for puzzles and numbers
  from which people can learn about the world of cryptology.</p></br>
