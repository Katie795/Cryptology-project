 <p> Throughout history, the need to communicate in secret has been imperative in times of war, political scandal, and even in love affairs. Sometimes
   the safety of a nation, or the outcome of a war depended on a message successfully reaching the rightful recipient, without being found
   by enemies. Over the years, people have come up with cleverer and cleverer ways of securing their message, always trying to stay a step ahead
   of the cryptanalysts, who would search for weaknesses and find techniques to exploit these.</p>

  <p>In this website, we have picked some of our favourite ciphers and invite you to learn a little about the history and the structure of the cipher!
  If you are up for a challenge, we have included a ciphertext at the bottom of each page, which we invite you to have a go at. The ciphers get
  increasingly more challenging so don't worry if you get stuck! If you manage to solve the last two, let us know (as they are very difficult), and we
  will add you to our hall of fame!</p>

  <p>We hope you enjoy our website as much as we liked making it!</p>

             <p>Code First: Girls aims to deliver free community coding courses to female university students all over the UK and from this we
               were able to learned how to make our own website using a variety of different programming languages.
               Using the skills that had been taught and our joined passion for puzzles and numbers we decided to create ''
