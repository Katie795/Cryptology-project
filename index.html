  <h2>Cryptology through the ages</h2>
  <p>A brief description of a few types of encryption employed throughout history.

  * Notes for reference*
  This is not a full history of Ciphers throughout the ages, rather the aim of this site is to try and introduce some of the stories and techniques, and to see how it has changed through the years.

  Target Audience: Perhaps young people who are interested in puzzles and techniques

  Introduction and background

  Exciting introduction and brief explanation for the general cipher

  With the evolution of language and writing, it seems like in every culture there has also been an evolution of the means to secrecy. Ever since humans have been at war with each other, the need to communicate secretly has been important.  There has been a constant race between the code makers and the code breakers, like an intellectual arms race.

  The main focus of this site will be cryptology, which is defined as the science of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Kryptos is the Greek work for to hide, graphein to write and analusis to unloosen. A cipher is a tool used by the cryptographer to create a ciphertext, from the message that the sender wants to send. Using the right Key, the receiver should be able to decipher the message with ease,  however it should be difficult to decode.

<h3>The Caesar cipher (Difficulty rating?)</h3>
<p>This is one of the earliest known examples of ciphers in written history, appearing in Julius Caesars’ Gallic Wars, where a war
is won by with the help of this cipher. In fact, Julius Caesar was a big fan of Ciphers, according to Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars’s.</p>

<p>This Cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet a number of terms to the left. In the simplest example, you only shift once,
so A goes to B, B goes to C etc, as seen in this diagram. </p>

<p>However, as you can see, there are 24 other possible combinations to choose from,
so it is not a very secure form of coding, as the solution can often be found by simply trying all the possible combnations!</p>

Let's see if you can solve this one!

<h3>The Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
This is the name given to any substitution cipher where the cipher alphabet is either letters or symbols. A Substitution cipher.  There are 40000000000000000000000000 possible outcomes. Frequency analysis invented by Al Kindi, the ‘Philosopher of Arabs’ Short texts likely to deviate from the norm. Until 1500 the codebreakers had the upper hand, was the safest form of encryption. Describe how to crack.

Describe and example

The key to cracking this cipher lies in the fact that some letters appear more than others, depending on the language. For example, Al Kindi found that the letters a and l appear more often that the other letters in Arabic. Likewise, in English, the most common letter in English is e, which occurs 12.7% of the time, followed by t, then a, then o. Of course, the shorter the text, the more likely the letters are to deviate from the norm!

<h3>The Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
Also called the Chiffre Inde(acute)chiffrable. Had been in the process of being made but was finalised by Blaise de Viginere, a French diplomat. Polyalphabetic. Broken by Charles Babbage an English Mathematitian.

Describe and example

After the discovery of the tool of frequency analysis to crack the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, a new type of code had to be invented. The idea was to use not just one, but several Caesar ciphers all at once, so frequency analysis is rendered useless. Look at this diagram:

Use a codeword to pick the order of the Caesar Ciphers. Under this word, Hello would be translated to, hence the double l could no longer be analysed.

<h3>Homophonic substitution cipher</h3>
Same sound. Military operations needed quick and reliable ciphers. This was much easier to implement than a polyalphabetic one. The man in the iron mask

<h2>Section 2: Post digital</h2>

<h3>The Enigma machine(Perhaps a note on how we can’t do a challenge? Or remove it altogether?)</h3>
Bletchly park. Alan Turing, and a team of cryptanalysists. A captured enigma machine. Figured out how it works, and how it is implemented.

Describe and example


<h3>The RSA code</h3>
The RSA code was accredited to Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, a team of researchers in MIT, laboratories, who finalised the idea of an asymmetric cipher in 1977 first published by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. However, the idea was originally thought up by Clifford Cocks in 1973 in GCHQ, but it's discovery was kept secret for national security reasons.
