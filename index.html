  <h2>Cryptology through the ages</h2>
  <p>A brief description of a few types of encryption employed throughout history.

  * Notes for reference*
  This is not a full history of Ciphers throughout the ages, rather the aim of this site is to try and introduce
  some of the stories and techniques, and to see how it has changed through the years.

  Target Audience: Perhaps young people who are interested in puzzles and techniques

  Introduction and background

  Exciting introduction and brief explanation for the general cipher

  With the evolution of language and writing, it seems like in every culture there has also been an evolution
  of the means to secrecy. Ever since humans have been at war with each other, the need to communicate secretly
  has been important.  There has been a constant race between the code makers and the code breakers, like an
  intellectual arms race.

  The main focus of this site will be cryptology, which is defined as the science of cryptography and cryptanalysis.
   Kryptos is the Greek work for to hide, graphein to write and analusis to unloosen. A cipher is a tool used by the
   cryptographer to create a ciphertext, from the message that the sender wants to send. Using the right Key, the receiver
   should be able to decipher the message with ease,  however it should be difficult to decode.
