  <h3>The Caesar cipher (Difficulty rating?)</h3>
  <p>This is one of the earliest known examples of ciphers in written history,
  appearing in Julius Caesars’ Gallic Wars, where a war is won by with the
   help of this cipher.
   In fact, Julius Caesar was a big fan of Ciphers, according to Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars’s.</p>

  <p>This Cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet a number of terms to the left.
For instance, you could shift the alphabet 7 terms to the right, check out this table! </p>

  <p>However, as you can see, there are 24 other possible combinations to choose from, so it is not a
  very secure form of coding, as the solution can often be found by simply trying all the possible combinations!
It is even easier if you can narrow it down beforehand, for instance the only single letter words in English are a, and I,
so they are good words to look out for.</p>

  <p>Let's see if you can solve this one!</p>
