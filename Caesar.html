  <h3>The Caesar cipher (Difficulty rating?)</h3>
  <p>This is one of the earliest known examples of ciphers in written history,
  appearing in Julius Caesars’ Gallic Wars, where a war is won by with the
   help of this cipher.
   In fact, Julius Caesar was a big fan of Ciphers, according to Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars’s.</p>

  <p>This Cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet a number of terms to the left.
  In the simplest example, you only shift once, so A goes to B, B goes to C etc, as seen in this diagram.</p>

  <p>However, as you can see, there are 24 other possible combinations to choose from, so it is not a
  very secure form of coding, as the solution can often be found by simply trying all the possible combinations!</p>

  Let's see if you can solve this one!
