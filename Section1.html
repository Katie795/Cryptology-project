<h3>The Caesar cipher (Difficulty rating?)</h3>
<p>This is one of the earliest known examples of ciphers in written history,
  appearing in Julius Caesars’ Gallic Wars, where a war is won by with the
   help of this cipher.
   In fact, Julius Caesar was a big fan of Ciphers, according to Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars’s.</p>

<p>This Cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet a number of terms to the left.
  In the simplest example, you only shift once, so A goes to B, B goes to C etc, as seen in this diagram.</p>

<p>However, as you can see, there are 24 other possible combinations to choose from, so it is not a
  very secure form of coding, as the solution can often be found by simply trying all the possible combinations!</p>

Let's see if you can solve this one!

<h3>The Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
<p>This type of cipher is a step up from the Caesar cipher in that instead of having just 25 possible ciphers,
  any permutation of letters is allowed! See diagram
 This means that there are 40000000000000000000000000 possible outcomes that could happen! In fact, up until the 16th Century,
 this cipher seemed impossible to crack. The technique of frequency analysis was invented
  by Al Kindi, the ‘Philosopher of Arabs’, and was a major breakthrough in the battle between cryptographers and cryptanalysists.</p>


<p>The key to cracking this cipher lies in the fact that some letters appear more than others, depending on the language. For example,
Al Kindi found that the letters a and l appear more often that the other letters in Arabic. Likewise, in English, the most common
 letter in English is e, which occurs 12.7% of the time, followed by t, then a, then o. Of course, the shorter the text, the more
 likely the letters are to deviate from the norm!</p>

<h3>The Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
Also called the Chiffre Inde(acute)chiffrable. Had been in the process of being made but was finalised by Blaise de Viginere, a French diplomat. Polyalphabetic. Broken by Charles Babbage an English Mathematitian.

Describe and example

After the discovery of the tool of frequency analysis to crack the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, a new type of code had to be invented. The idea was to use not just one, but several Caesar ciphers all at once, so frequency analysis is rendered useless. Look at this diagram:

Use a codeword to pick the order of the Caesar Ciphers. Under this word, Hello would be translated to, hence the double l could no longer be analysed.
Challenge

<h3>Homophonic substitution cipher</h3>
Same sound. Military operations needed quick and reliable ciphers. This was much easier to implement than a polyalphabetic one. The man in the iron mask
