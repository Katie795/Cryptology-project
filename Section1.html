<h3>The Caesar cipher (Difficulty rating?)</h3>
First appears in Julius Caesars’ Gallic Wars. He used them a lot. One found in Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars’s. Only 25 here.

Describe + example

This Cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet a number of terms to the left. In the simplest example, you only shift once, so A goes to B, B goes to C etc, as seen in this diagram. However, as you can see, there are 24 other possible combinations to choose from. Here is an example.

<h3>The Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
This is the name given to any substitution cipher where the cipher alphabet is either letters or symbols. A Substitution cipher.  There are 40000000000000000000000000 possible outcomes. Frequency analysis invented by Al Kindi, the ‘Philosopher of Arabs’ Short texts likely to deviate from the norm. Until 1500 the codebreakers had the upper hand, was the safest form of encryption. Describe how to crack.

Describe and example

The key to cracking this cipher lies in the fact that some letters appear more than others, depending on the language. For example, Al Kindi found that the letters a and l appear more often that the other letters in Arabic. Likewise, in English, the most common letter in English is e, which occurs 12.7% of the time, followed by t, then a, then o. Of course, the shorter the text, the more likely the letters are to deviate from the norm!

<h3>The Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
Also called the Chiffre Inde(acute)chiffrable. Had been in the process of being made but was finalised by Blaise de Viginere, a French diplomat. Polyalphabetic. Broken by Charles Babbage an English Mathematitian.

Describe and example

After the discovery of the tool of frequency analysis to crack the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, a new type of code had to be invented. The idea was to use not just one, but several Caesar ciphers all at once, so frequency analysis is rendered useless. Look at this diagram:

Use a codeword to pick the order of the Caesar Ciphers. Under this word, Hello would be translated to, hence the double l could no longer be analysed.
Challenge

<h3>Homophonic substitution cipher</h3>
Same sound. Military operations needed quick and reliable ciphers. This was much easier to implement than a polyalphabetic one. The man in the iron mask
